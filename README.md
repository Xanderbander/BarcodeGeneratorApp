# Barcode Generator App (PDF417) - AAMVA Standard

This Java program generates a PDF417 barcode based on the AAMVA standard using input information provided by the user. The barcode is displayed in the UI and also saved as a PNG file.

## Setup Instructions

### Running on Replit:
1. Import this repository into Replit.
2. Ensure you have a Java environment installed (Replit automatically detects the Java environment).
3. The GUI uses Java Swing to create forms and display the barcode.
4. You may need to adapt this to a Replit-compatible UI or run the program locally.

### Dependencies:
- ZXing (for barcode generation)
- Java Swing (for GUI components)
